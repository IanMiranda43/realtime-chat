It's an simple chat application socket.io based. The front-end is not the focus so it's using an template based on an [SamimOnline's](https://bootsnipp.com/SamimOnline) work.

At now the system can serve static multiple connected front-ends. When a message is sent, another users receive it and print in your message card. An simple login system without authentication is in progress too.


### The system use: 

* `Socket.io` for real time communication
